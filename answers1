'''
step one store data to text file:
'''
with open('file.txt',"w+") as file:
    content = file.write('This file contains 5 lines\n'
                         'Line one is alone\n'
                         'line two is tougher than line one\n'
                         'line three have a lot of data inside it, but all is useless\n'
                         'line four is gonna score\n'
                         'line five will survive')
    file.close()
'''step 2: Read the file and append to the list or use readlines method that automatically put everything inside a list'''
links = []
with open("file.txt","r+") as f:
    data = f.readlines()
    # for line in data:
    #     links.append(line)
# for x in links:
#     print(x.strip())
for x in data:
    print(x.strip())
